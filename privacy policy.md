# Privacy Policy

Moonface built the Collabocode app as a Free app. This service is provided by Moonface at no cost and is intended for use as is. 
This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service. 
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

Moonface takes personal privacy very seriously.

As a general rule we do not collect your personal information unless you chose to provide that information to us.
Collabocode stores your data in a secured Firebase database. We will do our best in keeping that data secure, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Collabocode requires users to sign in with their account in the first use, and then remembers the account, so you won't need to sign in every time you want to use Collabocode. Consequently, you are responsible for keeping the access to your phone safe.
In addition, we want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of a crash in the app we collect data (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data.
You have the choice to delete your account. Just go into settings -> Account -> Delete account.

We may update this policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
